WS | 2013 | Introduction to Women | P | C | | This course introduces students to core concepts and frameworks in women’s, gender, and sexuality studies, using interdisciplinary and cross-cultural approaches.

The course will provide students with the tools of critical feminist inquiry to assess how women’s lived experiences are shaped by such categories as race, ethnicity, class, nationality, sexuality, and disability. Students will examine theories and analytical concepts that emerge from specific historical periods and social movements. May be applied toward the Core Curriculum requirement in Language, Philosophy and Culture. (Formerly WGS 2013. Credit cannot be earned for both WS 2013 and WGS 2013.).
