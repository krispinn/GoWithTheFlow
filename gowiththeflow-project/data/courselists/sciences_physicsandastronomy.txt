AST | 1043 | Current Topics in Astronomy | P MAT 1023 MAT 1073 | C | Prerequisite: MAT 1023 or MAT 1073. | Astronomy receives considerable attention from the media and the public in general. It allows us to ask fundamental questions about who we are, where we come from, and where we will end up as a world. This course will concentrate on the areas of astronomy that are currently most covered by the media—planet detection and interpretation, recent NASA spacecraft missions, supermassive black holes, gamma-ray bursters, dark matter and dark energy in the Universe, and other significant developments that arise during the semester. This course will cover each of these in depth, but will also concentrate on the reaction that the media has had on them. The media and public often have an uncanny ability to probe directly to the main reasons for why scientists study a particular problem. The student who completes this course will be expected to not only have a better scientific understanding of the current hot topics in astronomy, but also understand how the media can actually drive science in general.
AST | 1073 | Astrobiology | P MAT 1023 MAT 1073 | C | Prerequisite: MAT 1023 or MAT 1073. | The concept that life might exist elsewhere besides the Earth has intrigued humankind for centuries. Technology has now enabled this fundamental question to be pursued with substantial international scientific vigor. Within the Solar System, several Mars probes, as well probes to the moons of Jupiter (Europa) and Saturn (Titan), are being developed with specific emphasis on the development of in-situ instrumentation to detect the presence of life. Beyond the Solar System, the search for life signs has gained momentum with the rapid growth in the number of known exoplanets. While the detection of exoplanets is challenging conventional views of planet formation, it has also created opportunities for new observational methods to detect and characterize habitability and bio-signatures. The study of life on Earth has revealed surprising constraints on the limits of life with the discovery of extremophiles capable of surviving in near-freezing, near-boiling, nonaqueous, or high-radiation environments. This interdisciplinary course involves topics in astronomy, planet formation, and biology.
